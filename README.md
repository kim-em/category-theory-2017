# category-theory-2017

This is the webpage for the category theory reading course at ANU for 2017. You might also enjoy watching the [Catster's videos](https://www.youtube.com/user/TheCatsters). Wikipedia often has quite good content on category theory. A classic book (the early parts of which are quite readable) is MacLane's ''Categories for the working mathematician''.

The plan
---
Please start reading Tom Leinster's [Basic Category Theory](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.09375.pdf).

* Week 1:
    * An Ran, on the definitions of categories, functors and natural transformations.
    * I encourage you to all bring an example of a natural transformation, and to discuss these examples after An Ran's presentation.
* Week 2:
    * By the meetings, please finish reading Chapter 1.
    * Zac, on free, faithful, and essentially surjective functors, as well as initial and terminal objects.
* Week 3:
    * Yahya
* Week 4:
    * James

Reports
---
After your presentation, please write a report (at least one page). It should:
* State who was there.
* Indicate the material you covered in your presentation.
* Note any difficulties or confusions that arose, particularly those that were not resolved in discussion with the group.
* Indicate the topics covered in the discussion after the presentation.
* Evaluate your presentation of the material. Could you have arranged things differently, to better aid understanding? Was there too much or too little technical detail? Did you facilitate a constructive discussion after the presentation? Any other comments?

Grading
---
* a report on your class presentation (10%)
* four written assignments (10% each, for 40% total)
* a final essay (approx. 10 pages, on a topic of your choice related to the material we cover) (35%)
* a final presentation (by default, on the same topic as your final essay) (15%)
